    "# Safe Driving Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Inaccuracies in car insurance company’s claim predictions raise the cost of insurance for good drivers and reduce the price for bad ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction), the challenge is to build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. While Porto Seguro has used machine learning for the past 20 years, they’re looking to Kaggle’s machine learning community to explore new, more powerful methods. A more accurate prediction will allow them to further tailor their prices, and hopefully make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers.\n",

These packages have various features, as well as a lot of clustering, regression and classification algorithms that make it a good choice for data mining and data analysis.
